/**
 * Suspending a thread:
 * 1. Time: - using sleep() method, example:- Thread.sleep(1000);
 *
 * 2. Conditionally :- using join, example:- t1.join();
 * Letâ€™s assume that we have two threads available t1 and t2.
 * now if we have a condition that inside run() method of t1 we need to use some of the values calculated in run()
 * method of t2,then in this case we have to stop the execution of run() method of t1 until the run() method of t2 is
 * completely executed. in such situation we have to make use of join() method.
 *Example:- count the number in using thread1 and print using thread 2
 * 3. Unconditionally.
