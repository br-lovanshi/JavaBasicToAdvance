Answers:

1. Basic Java Concepts:

Abstract class vs. Interface: An abstract class can have both methods with or without implementation, while an interface can only declare method signatures that classes implementing it must define.
Static keyword: static is used for class-level members that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
Final keyword: final is used to indicate that a variable, method, or class cannot be changed or extended.
2. Object-Oriented Programming:

Multiple inheritance: Java achieves multiple inheritance through interfaces, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
Method overloading: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
Method overriding: Providing a new implementation for a method in a subclass that's already defined in its superclass.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit.
3. Java Collections:

List, Set, and Map: These are interfaces in the Java Collections framework for holding collections of elements with different characteristics.
ArrayList vs. LinkedList: ArrayList is backed by an array, good for random access. LinkedList is a linked structure, suitable for frequent insertions/deletions.
HashMap: It's a key-value store using hash codes for efficient data retrieval.
4. Exception Handling:

try-catch-finally: try defines a block where exceptions might occur, catch handles exceptions, and finally contains code that runs regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
Checked vs. unchecked exceptions: Checked exceptions must be caught or declared, while unchecked exceptions (subclasses of RuntimeException) don't need explicit handling.
5. Concurrency:

Thread vs. Process: A thread is a unit of execution within a process. A process is an independent program running in its own memory space.
Synchronization: Mechanism to prevent multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously.
synchronized: Keyword to make methods or blocks thread-safe. java.util.concurrent provides advanced concurrency utilities.
6. Spring Framework:

Spring framework: A framework for building Java applications, providing infrastructure support, and reducing boilerplate code.
Dependency injection: Objects are provided with their dependencies instead of creating them internally.
Spring Boot: A Spring module that simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.
7. Database Interaction:

Database connection: Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect Java applications to databases.
ORM framework: ORM frameworks like Hibernate map Java objects to database tables, simplifying database interaction.
8. RESTful Web Services:

RESTful API: An architectural style for designing networked applications, using HTTP methods and URLs.
Creating RESTful service: Use libraries like Spring to define endpoints using annotations, mapping them to methods in your code.
9. Testing:

Unit testing: Writing tests for individual components or methods to ensure they work correctly.
JUnit/TestNG: Testing frameworks that provide annotations and utilities to write and execute tests.
10. Version Control:

Version control systems: Tools like Git track changes to code over time.
Merge conflicts: Occur when different branches have conflicting changes. Developers resolve them to combine changes properly.
